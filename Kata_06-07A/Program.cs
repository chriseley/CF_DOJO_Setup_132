//Ask the user "What is your age"
//Store the user input in a variable 'age'

//Use if statements to determine if the userInput is 'of age' to drink
//if age < 5 && age >=0 -> print "I'm calling your parents!"
//else if age < 10 -> print "Come on? are you serious?"
//else if age < 18 -> print "Sorry you are too young to drink, come back in three years!"
//else if if age >= 21 -> print "Hawdy, What can I get you to drink!"
//else -> print "Invalid Option, please try again."

//use a terinary operator to check if a persons age using the age variable above 
//to check if the person is a child or not   
//so if a persons age is greater than 12 the he/she is not a child, else 
//the person is a child 

//Create an 'Array of int' that can hold a total of 10 items
//Create a 'decimal' Array that can hold 5 names
//Create a 'string' Array that can hold 5 names

//Create a 'List<int>' childAges ,that can hold a total of 5 times
//Create a 'List<decimal>' grades ,that can hold a total of 5 times
//Create a 'List<string>' teacherNames ,Array that can hold 5 names


//while loop -> while loop through the variable childAges, grades, and teacherNames
